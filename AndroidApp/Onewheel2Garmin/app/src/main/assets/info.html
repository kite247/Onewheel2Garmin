<h2>What does this App do?</h2>
This App allows you to see the battery and range info for your Onewheel on your compatible Garmin watch. It works by reading the battery/range notification info from FutureMotion's Onewheel App and forwards the data to an app running on your Garmin watch. 
<h2>Garmin Requirements</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Make sure you installed the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.garmin.android.apps.connectmobile&hl=en_US">Garmin Connect App</a> on your phone</li>
	<li>Your Garmin watch needs to be set up and paired within the Garmin Connect App</li>
	<li>After that, install the <a href="https://apps.garmin.com/en-US/apps/cd720c95-609a-4cbf-991c-dfde0f42af8b">OW2Garmin</a> App on your Garmin watch</li>
</ul>
<h2>Onewheel App Requirements</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Make sure you installed <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rideonewheel.onewheel&hl=en_US">FutureMotion's Onewheel App</a> on your phone</li>
	<li>Open the Onewheel App and make sure it is connected to your Onewheel and shows the battery status</li>
	<li>When connected, you should see a permanent notification in your notification center that shows the current Onewheel connection status and battery info. If you do not see this notification, then the Onewheel2Garmin App won't be able to read the battery info either.</li>
